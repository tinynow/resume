# Why don't you care?

We are surrounded by people who act without care and don't care enough to act. The most careless right now seem to be those who don't vaccinate themselves. They don't care about the people they harm. They don't care about their own safety. People who toss their trash out the window, people who drive fast through the neighborhood, people who put "fuck your feelings" bumper stickers on their fuel-guzzling trucks, seem like people who just don't care. It seems so obvious that this is not a good way to live, that it is ethically, spiritually, and even pragmatically wrong. Why don't they care?

## Caring as a coder

I experience similar gut reactions as an advocate for accessibility and as a web developer who cares. 



But after having despaired about the cruel world for too many years

Don't they care about keyboard accessibility. Don't they care about the people that will not be able to use the thing they are creating. Don't they care that this is totally broken on mobile. Don't they care about the people (me) who has to maintain this code in the future.

Caring as a part of an institution

But is it obvious. What exactly is caring? A little thinking about it, reveals that the meaning of the word is as squishy as a human brain. Why don't people care? Because there really is no such thing.

One does not care. One cares _for_ or _about_ something or someone.

## So what is it?

Caring is attention. It isn't that much more useful to exclaim, "Why don't they attend?" But it reveals more about what is actually happening. Someone who seems to be careless about a thing is someone who:

- Doesn't know to attend to the thing
- Doesn't want to attend to it
- Knows and wants to attend but must attend to other mutually exclusive things









Lack of attention is a lot easier to forgive than lack of care
